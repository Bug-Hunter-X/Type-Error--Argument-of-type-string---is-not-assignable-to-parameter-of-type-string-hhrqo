This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript. The file `bug.ts` contains code that produces a type error, while `bugSolution.ts` shows how to fix the error. The error occurs because an array of strings is passed as an argument to a function that expects a single string argument. The solution involves either modifying the function signature to accept an array or modifying the way the array is used in the function call.
